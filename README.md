GEREMIA TIRAMISU Website

Every time you push a new version of the website remember to add a CNAME file containing the right URL
To create a CNAME file all you need to do is:
1- Open the Notepad and write only the URL (www.geremiatiramisu.com)
2- Save the file as "CNAME" (with no file extensions such as "CNAME.txt", simply "CNAME")
3- Move the file in the folder to be uploaded (geremiatiramisu.github.io), upload and it's done!
